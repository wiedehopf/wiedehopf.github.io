    This is a minimal reproducer for a Chromium browser bug.<br>
    <br>
    A variable is read as NaN in setInterval context despite not being NaN.<br>
    While i'm multiplying 0 with Math.PI here, i've observed this bug in a<br>
    different context i can't reproduce where a simple timestamp was assigned to<br>
    the variable afterwards being read as NaN.<br>
    <br>
    For this reproducer, using the multiplication of 0 and Math.PI or Math.E<br>
    seems necessary, i don't know why.<br>
    <br>
    The function accessing testVar being in a different js source file was a<br>
    requirement to reproduce at least for me.<br>

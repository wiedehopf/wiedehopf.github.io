    This is a minimal reproducer for a Chromium browser bug:<br>
    <a href="https://issues.chromium.org/issues/401652934">https://issues.chromium.org/issues/401652934</a><br>
    <br>
    A variable is read as NaN despite not being NaN.<br>
    <br>
    While this reproducer assigns testVar the value 0 * Math.PI,<br>
    i've observed this bug in a different context i can't reproduce where a simple <br>
    timestamp was assigned to the variable afterwards being read as NaN.<br>
    <br>
    For this reproducer, using the multiplication of 0 and Math.PI or Math.E<br>
    seems necessary, i don't know why.<br>
    <br>
    The function accessing testVar being in a different js source file was a<br>
    requirement to reproduce at least for me.<br>
